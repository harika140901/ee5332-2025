# Starter code for Pynq-Z1 board

The code in this folder can be used to automatically set up a basic project with the Pynq-Z1 board.  It uses Tcl scripts to automate part of this process, rather than using the GUI.  You are encouraged to use the GUI to learn the basics of how it works, but in the long term it is better to develop an understanding of how the Tcl based approach works.

## Creating and Building the project

The `scripts` folder contains a `Makefile`.  This has instructions for how to create the Vivado project, as well as generate the bitstream file to program the FPGA.

You need Vivado installed on your system - this script has been tested using Xilinx Vivado 2021.1 (yes, there are more recent versions but we are using this for various reasons primarily related to convenience and availability).

You should just be able to type `make bitfile` inside the `scripts` folder, and after about 5 minutes, get a project as well as a bitstream file to program the FPGA generated in the folder `build` (outside the scripts folder).
