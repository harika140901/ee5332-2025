# FPGA projects

These are basic starter projects for working with FPGAs, primarily targeted at the Pynq-Z1 board.  You should begin with `labs/fpga`.

They are targeted at students of EE5332 at IIT Madras, 2025 version.  It is not possible to respond to generic queries regarding these examples unless specifically related to something in class.
